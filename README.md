# Automated Daily Newsletter Service

## DISCLAIMER:

Owing to the fact that Google will be permanently disabling less secure app sign in just through username and password, this automatic mail sender will no longer be functional. I am looking for alternatives in the meantime.

___

If you go through the files, you will see how this service not only allows you to make a newsletter service of your own, but also lets you get mails reminding you about someone's birthday.

Now since I have hosted this on PythonAnywhere, which is free (to an extent), there is also a reminder which serves the purpose of reminding me to renew/extend my subscription on PythonAnywhere. However, you can edit this as per your needs and use it as and when required.

___

This Project took me quite sometime to make and was a pain in the neck at certain points (especially the HTML), so I hope that if you decide to use this service, you give credit to the creater/owner of this project (me!).

Thanks a ton!
